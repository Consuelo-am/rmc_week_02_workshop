# Overall Disease Burden Ghana, Switzerland and Chile

```{r}
# Load necessary packages
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, knitr, here)

# Import the overall disease data
data_overall <- read_csv(here("data/burden-of-disease-all-causes.csv"))
view(data_overall)
```

```{r}
# Filter the dataset to include only the three countries chosen by your group.
data_overall_mini <- data_overall %>% 
   filter(Entity %in% c("Ghana", "Switzerland", "Chile"))
#view(data_overall_mini)
#str(data_overall_mini)
```

## Table of Estimates for Overall Disease Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here render a table for the DALY burden over time for the three countries. 
# You should pivot the data wider to show each country in a separate column.
data_overall_wide <- data_overall_mini %>% 
  select(Year, Entity, `DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) - All causes - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)`) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Entity, values_from = `DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) - All causes - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)`)

# Use kable() from the knitr package to render the table.

kable(data_overall_wide, caption = "DALY Burden Over Time for Selected Countries")

```

## Plot Showing Trends in Overall Disease Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.
# NOTE: Use your long 'mini' data frame for plotting, not the wide data used for the table. 
```
