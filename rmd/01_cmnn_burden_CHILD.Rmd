# Communicable, Maternal, Neonatal, and Nutritional Disease Burden (CMNN)

```{r}
# Load necessary packages
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, knitr, here)

# Import the communicable diseases data
data_cmnn <- read_csv(here("data/burden-of-disease-cmnn.csv"))
```

# Filter the dataset to include only the three countries chosen by your group.
data_cmnn_mini <- data_cmnn %>%

## Table of Estimates for CMNN Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here render a table for the DALY burden over time for the three countries.
# You should pivot the data wider to show each country in a separate column.
data_cmnn_wide <- data_cmnn_mini %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = Entity,
              values_from = `DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) - Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)`) %>% 
  

# Use kable() from the knitr package to render the table.
  kable(caption = "DALY burden over time for Chile, Ghana and Switzerland")

```

## Plot Showing Trends in CMNN Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.
# NOTE: Use your long 'mini' data frame for plotting, not the wide data used for the table. 

ggplot(data = data_cmnn_mini, 
       aes(x = Year, 
           y = `DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) - Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)`, color = Entity)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  labs (title = "Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases in children over time",
        color = "country",
        y = "DALY Burden") +
  theme_minimal()

```

## Summary of CMNN Burden Findings

Ghana is the country with the highest burden of Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases, however from the year 1990 to 2020 it has decreased markedly. Chile's burden has also been declining over time, reaching levels similar to those of Switzerland by 2020. Switzerland has been rather stable over time, maintaining the lowest burden of the three countries.
