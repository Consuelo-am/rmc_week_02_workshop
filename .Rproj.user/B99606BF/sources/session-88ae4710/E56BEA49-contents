## Summary of NCD Burden Findings

Ghana has the overall highest burden on Communicable diseases in children compared to the other countries. Also, from the year 1990 to 2020, Switzerland and Chile have observed a significant decrease in the DALY burden among children, underscoring great improvement in the area while not so much improvement have been observed among children in Ghana.

## Summary of Overall Disease Burden Findings

Between 1990 and 2019, Ghana shows a gradual decline in the overall DALY burden, indicating improvements in public health, though the burden remains relatively high compared to the other two countries. Chile exhibits a moderate but steady decrease in DALYs over time, reflecting positive trends in disease prevention and healthcare access. In contrast, Switzerland consistently reports the lowest DALY burden throughout the period, with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a stable healthcare system.
